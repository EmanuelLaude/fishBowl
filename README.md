# Fish Bowl

Simulation of a fish bowl with fish and their social behavior. Fish are represented as colored dots. Every fish is attracted to certain fish and avoids others.
The social behavior is simulated by certain "gravitational" forces as in the 3-body problem from physiscs.

This code is inspired from the (solution to) of Aufgabe 21.1.4 of the 22nd Bundeswettbewerb Informatik 2003. See https://alumni.bwinf.de/wiki/_media/bwinf/aufgaben/22r1druck.pdf
